I'm a Master's in Computer Science at UC San Diego. I graduated from Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU), supervised by [Prof. Shen zhao](https://hnyz979.github.io/), [Prof. Keze Wang](https://kezewang.com/) and [Prof. Liang Lin](http://www.linliang.net/).

## Research Interests

I'm interested in AI & Robotics, especially for the social behaviors and interactions of embodied agents. I'm currently exploring **Long-term Memory, Humanoid Loco-manipulation, Spatial Intelligence, Social Intelligence and Agentic System** to pave my way to Emotional Humanoind Robots.

I'm seeking unified approch and mathematical framework to model the consistency of self-awareness, which may lies in the combination of embodiment, personal memory and world model.
