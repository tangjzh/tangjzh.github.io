I'm Jinzhou Tang, a Master's in Computer Science at UC San Diego. I graduated from Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU), supervised by [Prof. Shen zhao](https://hnyz979.github.io/), [Prof. Keze Wang](https://kezewang.com/) and [Prof. Liang Lin](http://www.linliang.net/). I'm interested in AI & Robotics, especially for the social behaviors and interactions of embodied agents. I'm exploring **Long-term Memory, Humanoid Mani-locomotion, Spatial Intelligence, Social Intelligence and Agentic System** to pave my way to Human-centered Emotional Humanoind Robots.
