I'm a Master's in Computer Science at UC San Diego. I graduated from Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU), supervised by [Prof. Shen zhao](https://hnyz979.github.io/), [Prof. Keze Wang](https://kezewang.com/) and [Prof. Liang Lin](http://www.linliang.net/).

## Research Interests

I'm interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Robotics, especially for the social behaviors and interactions of embodied agents. I'm currently exploring **Long-term Memory, Humanoid Loco-manipulation, Spatial Intelligence and AI Agent** to pave my way to General Humanoid Robots. Specifically, my research focuses on closed-loop visuomotor system that can produce long-horizon humanoid behaviors applicable to real-world.

For long-term research goal, I'm seeking unified approch and mathematical framework to model the consistency of self-awareness, which may lies in the combination of embodiment, personal memory and world model.
